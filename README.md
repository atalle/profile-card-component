## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow!

### What I learned

This was my first custom-coded project (not following a tutorial!) I used this exercise to practice building layouts with Flexbox, and enjoyed defining those content boxes before filling them in with content. 

### Continued development

My biggeest challenge was implementing the background pattern, and I'm not satisfied with how the pattern transitions between breakpoints. I'd like to study up on CSS positioning or learning alternative ways to solve this (maybe grid?) Open to all suggestions!
