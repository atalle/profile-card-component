## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow!

### What I learned

This was my first custom-coded project (not following a tutorial!) I picked this challenge to practice building layouts with Flexbox. Building the skeleton layout first (without content) helped me understand how flexbox properties affect one another. I also (finally) consumed all the documentation for CSS position properties in order to place the profile image and background patterns!

### Continued development

My biggeest challenge was implementing the background pattern, and I'm not satisfied with how the pattern transitions between breakpoints. I'd like to continue learning about CSS positioning, or find an alternative solution for this (maybe grid?) Open to all suggestions!
